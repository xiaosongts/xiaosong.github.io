      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three hundred and forty-eight years, six months, and nineteen days ago&#xA;to-day, the Parisians awoke to the sound of all the bells in the triple&#xA;circuit of the city, the university, and the town ringing a full peal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sixth of January, 1482, is not, however, a day of which history has&#xA;preserved the memory. There was nothing notable in the event which thus&#xA;set the bells and the bourgeois of Paris in a ferment from early morning.&#xA;It was neither an assault by the Picards nor the Burgundians, nor a hunt&#xA;led along in procession, nor a revolt of scholars in the town of Laas, nor&#xA;an entry of “our much dread lord, monsieur the king,” nor even a pretty&#xA;hanging of male and female thieves by the courts of Paris. Neither was it&#xA;the arrival, so frequent in the fifteenth century, of some plumed and&#xA;bedizened embassy. It was barely two days since the last cavalcade of that&#xA;nature, that of the Flemish ambassadors charged with concluding the&#xA;marriage between the dauphin and Marguerite of Flanders, had made its&#xA;entry into Paris, to the great annoyance of M. le Cardinal de Bourbon,&#xA;who, for the sake of pleasing the king, had been obliged to assume an&#xA;amiable mien towards this whole rustic rabble of Flemish burgomasters, and&#xA;to regale them at his Hôtel de Bourbon, with a very “pretty morality,&#xA;allegorical satire, and farce,” while a driving rain drenched the&#xA;magnificent tapestries at his door.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
